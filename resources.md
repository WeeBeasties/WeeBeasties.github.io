A variety of digital resources will be created for the assessment of the General Education program and described in this blog. All of these assets are intended to be freely shared with anyone interested in them. I will also place links to any files specifically mentioned in blog posts here. This will include those used in the General Education site and those just mentioned in this site. Since many of these are binary files (like Excel or Word files), they will be directly linked to from here. In most cases, the actual files will be housed on the OSF (binary files) or GitHub (flat files).
