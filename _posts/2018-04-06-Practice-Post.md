# Practice Post

This is a first try at using ```Gabriel``` to create a practice _Jekyll_ post for my **Reproducible Assessment** blog.  

I will have to see how this works out. Here is a formula to check out the ability to move $$ \LaTeX $$ code into posts as well. This seems to work ok to put symbols inline like alpha ($$ \alpha $$) and others. 

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$  

That should be enough for now.   

Adding a little mermaid code too in order to try out a simple Gantt chart:

<div class="mermaid">  
gantt
dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
title Adding GANTT diagram to mermaid

section A section
Completed task            :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
Active task               :active,  des2, 2014-01-09, 3d
Future task               :         des3, after des2, 5d
Future task2              :         des4, after des3, 5d  
</div>
