# Practice Post

This is a first try at using ```Gabriel``` to create a practice _Jekyll_ post for my **Reproducible Assessment** blog.  

I will have to see how this works out. Here is a formula to check out the ability to move $$ \LaTeX $$ code into posts as well. This seems to work ok to put symbols inline like alpha ($$ \alpha $$) and others. 

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$  

That should be enough for now.   

Adding a little mermaid code too (see if this updates):

<div class="mermaid">  
graph TD   
A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)   
B --> C{Let me think again}   
C -->|One| D[Laptop computer]   
C -->|Two| E[iPhone 6s]   
C -->|Three| F[Cheap Car]   
</div>
