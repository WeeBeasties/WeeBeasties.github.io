# Practice Post

This is a first try at using ```Gabriel``` to create a practice _Jekyll_ post for my **Reproducible Assessment** blog.  

I will have to see how this works out. Here is a formula to check out the ability to move $$ \LaTeX $$ code into posts as well. This seems to work ok to put symbols inline like alpha ($$ \alpha $$) and others. 

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$  

That should be enough for now.   

Adding a little mermaid code too in order to try out a simple Gantt chart:

<div class="mermaid">  

gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d

</div>
