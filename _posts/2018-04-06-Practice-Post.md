# Practice Post

This is a first try at using ```Gabriel``` to create a practice _Jekyll_ post for my **Reproducible Assessment** blog.  

I will have to see how this works out. Here is a formula to check out the ability to move $$ \LaTeX $$ code into posts as well.  

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$  

That should be enough for now.
