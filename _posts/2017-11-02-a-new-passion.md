Welcome to the Reproducible Assessment blog! I am finding this first post to be a bit awkward to write. So I am just going to begin by sharing a little bit about my purposes for creating this site and describing what sorts of things that I plan to discuss here.   

What should I talk about? The company, the founders, the business, the
culture? And all that knowing that virtually nobody will read except diggers
in a few years (hopefully)!

Let's concentrate instead on what we'll be blogging about. Company news
obviously, but not only. I expect we'll write quite a few posts about
technology, algorithms, entrepreneurship, marketing, and whatever else we'll
want to share with you :)

And most important, feel free to participate in comments or by contacting us
directly. We appreciate your feedback!

Welcome to the Algolia blog!
